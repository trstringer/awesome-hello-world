*"Hello World" examples for all languages, runtimes, platforms, etc.*

> "Your first running application with a new development language or platform is the most important one"

## Contributing

Contributions are **extremely** welcome and encouraged!  I simply don't have the ability to write *"Hello World"* apps for every single development implementation.  Don't see a simple *"Hello World"* app for a language you know?  Fork this repo, add the code, and create a pull request!

### Contributions/Pull Requests should have...

1. A new folder for a newly proposed language's *"Hello World"* application
2. A root `README.md` in the folder that has a **specific format** *(see below)*
3. Pre-code instructions on setting up the environment (i.e. you need to first download this, followed by installing this, and test out your environment like this)
4. One or more code files with ***runnable code*** (provided the pre-code steps and environment are correctly setup)

# ***new-language*** Hello World

## Pre-Code Install/Configuration
1. Download this ...
2. Install this ...
3. Configure this ...
4. Verify your environment is setup by doing this ...

## *(optional)* Development Steps

*This would include any steps that wouldn't be part of the code files themselves (i.e. Create a new project, select this project type, drag a button on the form, etc.)*

## *(optional)* Supplimental Code Explanation

*If there are code explanations that haven't been fully explained within the code (recommended) then this would be the place to write down any more human words to explain what the code does and/or why it does it*

#### **NOTE**: If there are pre-code and development steps that are platform-dependent, duplicate these sections and specify which section is for which platform (i.e. Windows, Linux, etc.)
