# Node.js Hello World

## Pre-Code Install/Configuration
1. Download the [most recent LTS version](https://nodejs.org/) of node.js
2. Install node.js from the downloaded file
3. Verify your environment by opening up a command prompt or terminal and run `node -v`.  The output should successfully list the version of node.js installed (i.e. `v4.4.0`)
4. You will need to use an existing text editor or development environment, or download and install another one (see below for a list of popular editors)

> :bulb: Any text editor will work.  We're just creating a flat file with a `js` file extension, so feel free to use the native `notepad`, `vim`, or whatever else you already have installed.  Editors are very much of a personal preference

## Development Steps

1. Open up your text editor or development environment of choice.  Popular ones include: 
  1. [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/)
  2. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  3. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  4. Vim
2. Write the code into a `js` file found in `helloworld.js`
3. Save your file
4. Run it from the command line or terminal by typing `node helloworld.js` in the location of the file
